## Work Environment  

The **Movie Ticket** app is built in **React** (a JavaScript library) on the front-end and **Flask** (Python) on the back-end. 
The back-end runs on port 5555, and front-end runs on port 3000. Therefore, the app's pages are accessible at the following local URLs:
- Home: - <http://localhost:3000/>  
- Signupt: - <http://localhost:3000/signup>
- Login: -<http://localhost:3000/login>
- User Profile: -<http://localhost:3000/profile> 

## Home

When a user opens the **Movie Ticket** app, it first loads the Home page. 
On the Home page, users can view a list of available movies. 
To purchase movie tickets, a user must login. If the user does not have an account, they will need to signup first.

If a user already has an account, then the logged-in **Home** page will display **Movie Cards**, through which the user can purchase tickets. 

## Movie Card

Each **Movie Card** displays the movie title in the top-left corner. 
There are also two dropdown menus: one for selecting the **number of tickets** and another for choosing the **showtime**.
The card shows the **ticket price** and the t**otal price**, which initially is $0.00. 
When the user selects the number of tickets, the **Total Price** updates automatically. 
At the bottom of the Movie Card, there is a **Buy Ticket** button. When the user clicks this button, they are redirected to the **Profile** page.

## Create Movie

At the bottom of the **Home** page, there is a **Create a New Movie** section. 
If a user wants to add a new movie to the list, they can fill out the form and click the **Create Movie** button. 
Once the button is clicked, the new movie will appear in the movie list.

## Signup  

When a user clicks on **Signup** button signup page will open up. 
The user can fill out the form by entering **Username**, **Password** and **Password Confirmation**. 
Once the form is submitted, the app saves the entered credentials, and the user is redirected directly to the **Profile** page. 

## Login

If a user wants to log in, they can click the **Login** button located at the top-right corner of the page.
A login form will appear in a window.
The user must enter their **Username** and **Password**, then click the **Login** button at the bottom of the form.
If the login is successful, the user will be redirected to their **Profile** page.
If the login fails, an error message ***"Username or password is incorrect"*** will be displayed.

## Profile

After signing up or logging in, the user can view their purchased tickets on the **Profile** page.
At the top-left corner, a welcome message appears: **"Welcome, (Username)!"**
Below the welcome message, there is a title that says **"Your Tickets:"** followed by the list of purchased tickets.

If the user wants to purchase more tickets, they can return to the **Home** page and select additional movies from the **Movie List**.

## Ticket card

Each ticket card displays information such as the **number of tickets**, **showtime**, **ticket price**, and **total price**.
Users can modify their tickets by adjusting the number of tickets or selecting a different showtime from the dropdown menu.
When the number of tickets is changed, the **Total** updates automatically.
If a user no longer wishes to watch a movie, they can delete the ticket by clicking the **Delete** button on the corresponding ticket card.
